## Python 3.8

Get the latest python from the [official download site](https://docs.python.org/3/) (currently 3.8).

There are instructions for Windows, macOS and Linux:
  - [Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html)
  - [macOS](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html)
  - [UNIX and UNIX like systems](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html)

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is a program for managing versions and history of code. We will be introducing git and its uses during the program.
(NOTE: for macOS, this assumes that a program called brew is installed. Brew is a package manager, a program that is used to download and install programs. This is a command line program, and has some requirements: https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)  

## Visual Studio Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a text editor that we will be using during the course. If you have a preferred text editor, feel free to use that instead, however all course material will be covered using VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts, visualizations, text editor layout, etc. so, it is our recommended editor.
